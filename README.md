# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the *Heart Disease Prediction* project, where cutting-edge machine learning techniques meet critical healthcare diagnostics. Dive into an exciting journey with us as we utilize data science to predict heart disease presence in patients. This project not only showcases the power of machine learning in healthcare but also serves as an educational toolkit for data scientists and medical professionals alike.

## Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making early and accurate diagnosis critically important. This project employs a comprehensive dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, applying advanced machine learning models to predict heart disease. Through the meticulous use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN), we explore the intricacies of medical data, uncover patterns, and aim to make a significant impact on preventive healthcare.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleansing and preparation of real-world heart disease dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Optimization of input data for maximum model performance.
- **Model Training:** Application of SVM and NN models with different configurations.
- **Accuracy Evaluation:** Rigorous testing to ensure the reliability and robustness of our predictions.
- **Insightful Analysis:** Interpretation of model outcomes to provide actionable healthcare insights.

## Technologies

This project is implemented using Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn for efficient data manipulation and machine learning tasks. Our methodology encompasses:

- Data loading and preprocessing to handle missing values and normalize the dataset.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- Training SVM models with various kernels and NN models with different optimizers to predict heart disease presence.
- Evaluating and comparing model accuracies to identify the most effective predictive approach.
